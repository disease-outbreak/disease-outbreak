    "The Disease Prognosis Project is a data-driven initiative aimed at early identification and monitoring of disease symptoms for all individuals. Leveraging data science and machine learning, we strive to improve prognosis and symptom surveillance to mitigate health risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can prognose a disease with high accuracy. By analyzing data acquired from the World Health Orginization related to disease symptoms in the U.S., we aim to create a reliable and user-friendly tool for individuals and public health organizations.\n",

    "- Overall extremely late responses are spread out throughout the city. There is a significant delay within calls listed as on time. Therefore, we would like to evaluate the amount of time between districts for calls that were considered on time. \n",

    "    - Do days of the week effect when the case was done?\n",
    "    - Are Mondays the slowest days because of the weekend backlog?\n",
    "    - Do minor holidays affect response time?\n",
    "- Obtain census data to gain insight more into zip codes, neighborhoods, and demographics beyond just the large districts.\n",
    "- Determine priority level for each call as a feature based on the number of days given and department to explore if there is a correlation with the level of delay.\n",
    "\n",
    "**We recommend...**\n",
    "  \n",
    "- The City of San Antonio should create standardized timelines for each department to follow when solving cases.\n",
    "- Animal Care Services and Customer Service should both have a thorough review of their cases and timelines to rectify latency issues.\n",
    "- Late and extremely late cases should be investigated through all departments.\n",
    "- The classification in the raw data set for whether a case was completed late or not needs to be re-made. This is due to an issue where this feature classifies cases as being late when they were completed as late. For example if a case was due in fifteen days but was completed a day before its due date, it would be classified as late.\n",
