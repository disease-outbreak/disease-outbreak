# Disease Outbreak Detection Project

## Abstract

The **Disease Outbreak Detection Project** is a data-driven initiative aimed at early identification and monitoring of disease outbreaks on a global scale. Leveraging data science and machine learning, we strive to improve disease surveillance and response strategies to mitigate health risks.

## Goal

The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can detect disease outbreaks with high accuracy and facilitate timely response measures. By analyzing diverse datasets related to health and epidemiology, we aim to create a reliable tool for public health organizations and authorities.
