### Description
The Disease Prognosis Project is a data-driven initiative aimed at early identification and monitoring of disease symptoms for all individuals. Leveraging data science and machine learning, we strive to improve prognosis and symptom surveillance to mitigate health risks.

### Goals
The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can prognose a disease with high accuracy. By analyzing data acquired from the World Health Orginization related to disease symptoms in the U.S., we aim to create a reliable and user-friendly tool for individuals and public health organizations.


    
### Data Source
- Data was gathered from "The World Health Organization" website
    - https://data.sanantonio.gov/dataset/service-calls/resource/20eb6d22-7eac-425a-85c1-fdb365fd3cd7
- Other data from the following website to create a dashboard of mortality rates.
    - https://sa2020.org/city-council-profiles

### Findings:
- Each department has better levels of response in certain areas.
- The departments with the lowest number of calls were more likely to have worse response times
- Internal requests were generally late in comparison to other forms of reporting. While mobile app was generally completed early.
- Customer Service generally got issues resolved late or very late.
- Animal Services usually only gave a day to complete a case and those cases usually took months to close.
- Winter months tend to have the longest average days open time, while Autumn months have the shortest.

### Stats Test 1:
  
#### Confidence level and alpha value:
- 95% confidence
  - alpha = 0.05
  

- What is the test?
    - ANOVA test.
- Why use this test?
    - The ANOVA test tests the means between many groups to determine if there is a difference.
- What is being compared?
    - The mean of days before or after due for each district.
- Question being asked:
    -Is there a significant difference between districts for days before or after due date?
    
#### Hypothesis:

- Null Hypothesis: There is no difference in days before or after due date between the districts.

- Alternative Hypothesis: There is a significant difference in days before or after due date between the districts.

#### Results:
- We reject the null hypothesis.

### Stats Test 2:
    
#### Confidence level and alpha value:
- 95% confidence
  - alpha = 0.05
    
- What
    - Chi$^2$ Test.
- Why use this test?
    - This test was used because it compares two categorical data variables.
- What is being compared?
    -   Call reason and level of delay
- Question being asked:
    - Is there a significant difference between the call reason and level of delay?

#### Hypothesis:
- Null Hypothesis: "The call reason of the issue and the level of delay are independent from each other"
    
- Alternative Hypothesis: "The call reason and the level of delay are dependent from one another."

#### Results:
- We reject the null hypothesis.

### Stats Test 3:
    
#### Confidence level and alpha value:
- 95% confidence
  - alpha = 0.05
    
- What is the test?
    - Mann-Whitney U Test.
- Why use this test?
    - This test was used because it is used to test whether two samples are likely to derive from the same population .
- What is being compared?
    - Response times between districts that fall below 20,000 per capita income and districts that fall above 20,000 per capita income.
- Question being asked:
    - Is there a difference for response time for all districts that fall below 20,000 per capita income and those that are above?
    
#### Hypothesis:
- Null Hypothesis: There is no difference between districts that fall below 20,000 per capita income and districts that fall above 20,000 per capita income response time.
    
- Alternative Hypothesis: There is a difference between districts that fall below 20,000 per capita income and districts that fall above 20,000 per capita income response time.

#### Results:
- We reject the null hypothesis

Summary of modeling choices...
        
### Models Made:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- KNN
- Ridge Classifier
- SGD Classifier

### Baseline Accuracy  
- 57.199%
      
| Model | Accuracy with Train | Accuracy with Validate |
| ---- | ----| ---- | 
| Logistic Regression | 61.1% | 61% |
| Decision Tree | 68% | 68% |
| Random Forest | 66.6% | 66.4% |
| KNN | 57%  | 57% |
| Ridge Classifier | 59% | 59% |
| SGD Classifier | 56% | 56% |
    
    
## Selecting the Best Model:

- Decision Tree

- Why did we choose this model?
    - This model ran the best accross train and validate.
    
- What does this model do?
    - Decision trees are flexible models that donâ€™t increase their number of parameters as we add more features (if we build them correctly). At each node of a decision tree, one of the features of our data is evaluated in order to make an specific data point follow a certain path when making a prediction.

### Model on All Data Sets

| Best Model | Accuracy with Train | Accuracy with Validate | Accuracy with Test|
| ---- | ----| ---- | ---- |
| Decision Tree | 68% | 68% | 68% |

**We found....**

- Each department is better in certain areas about being on time/early and late in others.
- The more calls a department had the better they were at getting issues resolved on time.
- Internal requests were generally late in comparison to other forms of reporting.
- When an issue was reported via the app, there were no extremely late responses.
- Customer Service generally got issues resolved late or very late. 
- Animal Services usually only gave a day to complete a case and those cases usually took months to close.
- Winter months tend to have the longest average days open time, while Autumn months have the shortest.

**With further time...**

- Overall extremely late responses are spread out throughout the city. There is a significant delay within calls listed as on time. Therefore, we would like to evaluate the amount of time between districts for calls that were considered on time. 
- Analyze the data further through time series analysis. Some questions that we would like to investigate are:
    - Do days of the week effect when the case was done?
    - Are Mondays the slowest days because of the weekend backlog?
    - Do minor holidays affect response time?
- Obtain census data to gain insight more into zip codes, neighborhoods, and demographics beyond just the large districts.
- Determine priority level for each call as a feature based on the number of days given and department to explore if there is a correlation with the level of delay.

**We recommend...**
  
- The City of San Antonio should create standardized timelines for each department to follow when solving cases.
- Animal Care Services and Customer Service should both have a thorough review of their cases and timelines to rectify latency issues.
- Late and extremely late cases should be investigated through all departments.
- The classification in the raw data set for whether a case was completed late or not needs to be re-made. This is due to an issue where this feature classifies cases as being late when they were completed as late. For example if a case was due in fifteen days but was completed a day before its due date, it would be classified as late.
